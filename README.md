# Coding test

In the following coding test, two questions were asked:
1. Replace letters in a string with the mapping below:
[a,A] -> 4
[e,E] -> 3
[i,I] -> 1
[o,O] -> 0
[s,S] -> 5
[t,T] -> 7
[b,D] -> 5
Note: [o,O] is not an owl face, it's the letter "o" and it should be replaced with a zero.
Objective: to convert a String into Leet.
Sample Input: Let's have some fun.
Sample Output: L37'5 h4v3 50m3 fun.

2. Manipulate strings with repeating characters aaabbbbccccc > a3b4c5
Objective: Take each repeated letter in a string, and re-arrange the string so each letter in the
string is shown once along with the number of times it is repeated. Do this serialized for each
instance of any letter, and not for the total number of times that letter is shown in the string.
Sample Input: aaabbdcccccf 
Sample Output: a3b2d1c5f1
Sample Input: hhhhhqqlllllllhhhppp 
Sample Output: h5q2l7h3p3,
The solution for above questions are in its respective folder.

## Instructions to run the program

Program is written in python3.6+ version and hence it is required to install python3 to run the following code. You can install the python3 either by installing simply python3 or by installing anaconda.

1. Clone the repository

Find the python.exe file location, for demonstration purpose I'll be using default path which is used by python3 installer
* Question 1
```
C:\Users\<username/pcname>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe Qusestion1\Solution1.py
```
OR If you have installed python using anaconda:
